The wolf starts speaking with a soft voice, and tell the boy he has nice silver, garlic smelling shoes.
Bob says, they are not silver, they are gray are you fokin' blind?
The wolf, still dizzy from the hit of the tree trunk can't tell
if the boy really is speaking British English or if he's retarded
from the hit.
